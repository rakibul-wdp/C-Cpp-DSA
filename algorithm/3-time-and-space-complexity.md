### Algorithm analysis

- There are multiple ways to solve one problem
- Ex: There are multiple algorithms to sort a list of numbers
- How do we analysis which one of them is the most efficient algorithm?
- Generally, when we talk about performance, we use an absolute measure
- If I can run 100 meters is 12 seconds, I'm faster than someone who takes 15 seconds
