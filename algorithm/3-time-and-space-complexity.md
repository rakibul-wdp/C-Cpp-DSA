### Algorithm analysis

- There are multiple ways to solve one problem
- Ex: There are multiple algorithms to sort a list of numbers
- How do we analysis which one of them is the most efficient algorithm?
- Generally, when we talk about performance, we use an absolute measure
- If I can run 100 meters is 12 seconds, I'm faster than someone who takes 15 seconds
- Time complexity - Amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size
- Space complexity - Amount of memory taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size

### How to represent complexity?

- Asymptotic notations
  - Mathematical tools to represent time and space complexity
  1. Bio-O Notation (O-notation) - Worst case complexity &check;
  2. Omega Notation (Ω-notation) - Best case complexity &cross;
  3. Theta Notation (θ-notation) - Average case complexity &cross;
