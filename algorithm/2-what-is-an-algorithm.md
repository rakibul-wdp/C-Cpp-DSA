### What is an algorithm?

- An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem

### Why algorithms?

- As a developer, you're going to come across problems that you need to solve
- Learning algorithms translates to learning different techniques to efficiently solve those problems
- One problem can be solved in many ways using different algorithms
- Every algorithm comes with its own tradeoffs when it comes to performance
