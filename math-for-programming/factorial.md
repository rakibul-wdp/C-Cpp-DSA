# Factorial

- A function defined for non-negative integers
  - 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
- n! = n x (n - 1) x (n - 2) x (n - 3) x ... x 3 x 2 x 1
- 4! = 4x3x2x1 = 24
- Exception: 0! = 1
  - Consider how other factorial are related
  - 5! = 120 -> divide it by 5 -> 24
  - 4! = 24 -> divide it by 4 -> 6
  - 3! = 6 -> divide it by 3 -> 2
  - 2! = 2 -> divide it by 2 -> 1
  - 1! = 1 -> divide it by 1 -> stays 1
  - 0! = 1

# Factorial - why?

- Consider a cricket team with 11 players
- How many batting orders are possible?
- What if we had 2 players?
  - Answer: 2
  - AB or BA
- What about 3 players?
  - Answer: 6
  - ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA
- These type of problems are part of "Combinatorics"
  - A branch of mathematics
  - Deals with permutation and combination
