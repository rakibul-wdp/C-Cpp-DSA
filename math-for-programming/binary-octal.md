# Binary <-> Octal

- Remember binary to decimal?
- Easier than that
- 8 and 16 are powers of 2, 10 is not!
  - 8 = 2^3 and 16 = 2^4
- 000 to 111 => 0 to 7 (Octal)
- 0000 to 1111 => 0 to F (Hexadecimal)
- Binary 10111011 to octal?
  - 010 111 011 => 273
- Octal 314 to binary?
  - 314 => 011 001 100
