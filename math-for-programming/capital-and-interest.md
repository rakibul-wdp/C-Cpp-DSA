# Capital and Interest

- Capital
- Interest
- Interest rate
  - Per 100 taka
  - Per 1 year (3 months, 6 months are also common)
- Simple interest vs compound interest
- Simple interest

  - I = P x n x r
  - Interest = Capital x Time unit x Interest rate

- Your friend deposits 7000 Tk in Sonali bank fir 3 tears which earn him an interest of 8%. What is the amount he gets after 3 years?

  - I = ?, P = 7000, n = 3, r = 8%
  - I = P x n x r
  - I = 7000 x 3 x 8%
  - I = 1680

- You deposit 5400 Tk and got back and amount of 6000 Tk after 2 years. Find the simple interest rate of the bank.
- Try without formula
- r = ?, P = 5400, n = 2, I = 6000 - 54000 = 600
- r = 1/18 = 1/18 x 100% = 5.56%
