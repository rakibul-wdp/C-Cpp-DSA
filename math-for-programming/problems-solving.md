### Question 01:

- Consider the following sets
- U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13}
- A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 7}
- B = {3, 4, 5, 6}
- Find the set - (AUB)'
- Answer: {8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13}

## Sets in Markdown

Consider the following sets:

- Universal Set (U): {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13}
- Set A: {1, 2, 3, 4, 7}
- Set B: {3, 4, 5, 6}

### Finding the Union of Sets A and B

To find the union of sets A and B (\(A \cup B\)), we combine all unique elements from both sets:

\[ A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\} \]

### Finding the Complement of \(A \cup B\)

To find the complement of the union of sets A and B, denoted as \((A \cup B)'\), we consider the universal set U and identify elements that are not in \(A \cup B\).

Universal Set U: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13}

\[
(A \cup B)' = \{8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13\}
\]

The complement \((A \cup B)'\) contains elements that are in the universal set U but not in the union of sets A and B.
