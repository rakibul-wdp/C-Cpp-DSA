# Question 01:

- Consider the following sets
- U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13}
- A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 7}
- B = {3, 4, 5, 6}
- Find the set - (AUB)'
- Answer: {8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13}

## Sets in Markdown

Consider the following sets:

- Universal Set (U): {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13}
- Set A: {1, 2, 3, 4, 7}
- Set B: {3, 4, 5, 6}

### Finding the Union of Sets A and B

To find the union of sets A and B (\(A \cup B\)), we combine all unique elements from both sets:

\[ A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\} \]

### Finding the Complement of \(A \cup B\)

To find the complement of the union of sets A and B, denoted as \((A \cup B)'\), we consider the universal set U and identify elements that are not in \(A \cup B\).

Universal Set U: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13}

\[
(A \cup B)' = \{8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13\}
\]

The complement \((A \cup B)'\) contains elements that are in the universal set U but not in the union of sets A and B.

# Question 02:

- Find the GCD and LCM of 77 and 121. Write the process in details.

## Finding the GCD and LCM of 77 and 121

### Finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)

The GCD of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. To find the GCD of 77 and 121, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which involves successive division and finding remainders.

Step 1: Divide 121 by 77:

- \(121 = 77 \times 1 + 44\)

Step 2: Divide 77 by 44:

- \(77 = 44 \times 1 + 33\)

Step 3: Divide 44 by 33:

- \(44 = 33 \times 1 + 11\)

Step 4: Divide 33 by 11:

- \(33 = 11 \times 3 + 0\)

At this point, we've reached a remainder of 0, which means that 11 is the GCD of 77 and 121.

So, GCD(77, 121) = 11.

### Finding the Least Common Multiple (LCM)

The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers. To find the LCM of 77 and 121, we can use the formula:

\[
LCM(a, b) = \frac{{\left| a \times b \right|}}{{GCD(a, b)}}
\]

In this case, \(a = 77\) and \(b = 121\), and we've already found that \(GCD(77, 121) = 11\).

So, we can calculate the LCM as follows:

\[
LCM(77, 121) = \frac{{\left| 77 \times 121 \right|}}{{11}} = \frac{{9317}}{{11}} = 847
\]

So, LCM(77, 121) = 847.

We have successfully found the GCD and LCM of 77 and 121.
