# Unitary Method

- Unite
- Unitary
- Problem solving method:

  - Find value for single unit
  - Then multiply for necessary units

- Problem: You and yur 6 friends went to a restaurant. All ordered the same meal, and the total bill was 1218 Taka. Now if you go there with your 2 best friends and have the same meal, what would be the bill this time?
- if 7 people spend 1218 then 1 people spend 174, So, 3 people spend 522 Taka.
- Given: Cost for 7 persons
- Goal: Finding cost for 3 persons
- Unitary method: Find cost for 1 person first
- Cost for 7 persons = 1218
- Cost for 1 person = 1218 / 7 = 174
- Cost for 3 person = 174 x 3 = 522

- Tom finishes his homework within 15 hours while Jerry takes 10 hours. How many hours will the same homework take to be done if they work together?
- Idea: How is their performance per hour?
- Tom's 15 hour of work === 1 homework
  - Tom's 1 hour of work === 1/15 homework
- Jerry's 10 hour of work === 1 homework
  - Jerry's 1 hour of work === 1/10 homework
- Tom and Jerry's 1 hour of work combined === (1/15 + 1/10) homework = 1/6 homework
- Answer: 6 hours

# Percentage

- Per hundred quantity
- Scaling reference to 100
- Example:

  - You gave a test on 40 marks. Your score was 32.
  - What would be the score if the test was taken with 100 marks?
  - May use unitary method
  - Out of 40 your score = 32
  - Out of 1 your score = 32/40
  - Out of 100 your score = (32/40) x 100 = 80
  - This is per hundred quantity, therefore, percentage!
  - You got 80% marks (see how we avoid mentioning the total marks!)

- You may just multiply the ratio with 100% (= 100 x 1/100 = 1)

  - (32/40) x 100% = 80%

  - answer 80 marks.

- 20 -> 16
- 40 -> 32
- 80 -> 64
- 100 -> 80

# Percentage Problem

- A clothing store is selling one of their most popular products at 870 Tk after 40% discount. What was the original price?
- Let it be x
- The discounted price = x x (100 - 40)% = x x 60/100 = 870
- The original price,
  - x = 870 x 100/60 = 1450
- 40% -> 870
- 10% -> 217.5
- 100% -> 2175 (original price)

- The price of oil increased by 25% and then decreased by 15%. What is the net percentage of increase or decrease in oil price?
- We don't know the initial value
- Let's assume the initial price was 100
- Increase by 25%: Updated price = 125
- Decrease by 15%:
  - Price gets reduced to 85%
  - Updated price = 125 x 85% = 125 x 85/100 = 106.25
- Final price is more than 100
- Net increase (106.25 - 100) = 6.25 if the original price was 100 (per hundred)
- Answer: Increased by 6.25%
