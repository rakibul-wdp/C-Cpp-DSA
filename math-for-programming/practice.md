# Practice

- 1101011 is binary number: Find its equivalent decimal number.
- 1 x 2^6 + 1 x 2^5 + 1 x 2^3 + 1 x 2^1 + 1 x 2^0
- 64 + 32 + 8 + 2 + 1
- 107

- Find the binary representation for 73 (a decimal number).
- 73 / 2 = 36; remainder = 1
- 36 / 2 = 18; remainder = 0
- 18 / 2 = 9; remainder = 0
- 9 / 2 = 4; remainder = 1
- 4 / 2 = 2; remainder = 0
- 2 / 2 = 1; remainder = 0
- 1 / 2 = 0; remainder = 1
- 1001001

- Is 77 a prime number?
- No

- What about 169? Prime or composite?
- composite

- Find out the 12th prime number.
- 37

- Find out sum of first n odd numbers. Try n = 1, 2, 3, ...
- 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, ...
- so, each time increase 1...

# Practice - 02

- Question 01: Choose a prime number from the range of 50 to 100. We will call it P. Write in Details.
- So, within the range of 50 to 100, the prime number I have chosen is 53. It meets the criteria of being greater than 1 and only divisible by 1 and itself, which are the defining characteristics of prime numbers.

- Question 02: Find the binary representation of P. You must show the process.
- D is the decimal number.
- Initialize B as an empty string.
- While D is greater than 0:
- Q = D / 2
- R = D % 2
- Append R to the beginning of B
- Set D to Q
- B now contains the binary representation of the original decimal number.

- Question 03: You and your friends in class might be choosing different values for P. Can anybody choose a P that is an odd number? Explain your answer.
- In mathematics, odd numbers are integers that cannot be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder. They are expressed as 2n + 1, where "n" is an integer. Even numbers, on the other hand, are integers that can be divided by 2 without a remainder and are expressed as 2n, where "n" is an integer.
  So, anybody can choose "P" to be an odd number, and there's no inherent mathematical restriction against it.

- Question 04: Ternary numbers are formed with a number system with base 3. Given the ternary number 10212, find its decimal value. Write in Details
- To find the decimal value of the ternary number 10212, you'll need to convert it from base 3 to base 10. To do this, you can use the positional notation system, just like you would for converting from binary to decimal.
- So, the decimal value of the ternary number 10212 is 104.
