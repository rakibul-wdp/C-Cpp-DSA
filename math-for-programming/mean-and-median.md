# Mean and Median

- Mean

  - Given some numbers
  - Take the sum of them
  - Divide by the count of numbers
  - You get the mean or average
  - Can you interpret the formula on right?
  - x bar = 1/n nEi=1 xi

- Example: You and your friends went to a restaurant. Everyone puts their money on the table and orders the same meal for all within budget. How much is the maximum budget for each person?
  - Money collected from 6 friends 103, 210, 57, 85, 500, 180
- Answer: Everyone has a budget of at most the average amount.
- (103 + 210 + 57 + 85 + 500 + 180) / 6 = 189.167

- Median

  - Given some numbers
  - Sort them in ascending order
  - Take the number found at the middle
  - If count is odd
    - Middle one is unique
  - If count is even
    - There are two elements in the middle
    - Take average of those two

- What does it mean to take the middle number?
- Say your median value is X
- Then ~50% of the values are less than X
- And ~50%of the values are greater than X
- 8, 7, 3, 2, 10
- Sort: 2, 3, 7, 8, 10
- Median: 7

- 8, 7, 3, 2, 0, 1
- Sort: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 10
- Median: (3+7)/2 = 5

- Why median?
- Because sometimes mean can be misleading
- Example:
- You try to walk everyday around 4km. Here is the history of ten days of your walking:
  - 3.5km, 7km, 5km, 4km, 4.5km, 24km, 5km, 5.5km, 5km, 6.5km
  - Mean 7km
  - Leave out the outlier 24km and mean would be: 5.11km
  - Let's look at the median
    - 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5, 5.5, 6.5, 7, 24 (sorted)
    - Median: (5+5)/2 = 5
  - Even if we leave out 24
    - 3.5 ,4 ,4.5 , 5, 5, 5.5, 6.5, 7
    - Median = 5
- Takeaway: Median cannot be deviated as much as mean by some outliers
