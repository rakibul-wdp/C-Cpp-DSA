# Recap

- GCD and LCM
- Euclidean algorithm for GCD (and LCM too)
- Factorials and a combinatorial problem
- Matrix and an application of them
- Power and roots
- Sets and set operations

# Basic Geometry

- Points and lines
- Coordinate System
- Angles
- Some geometric shapes

# Point

- Just a dot
- Location only
- No length, width, shape, size

# Line

- Two different points
- Connect them
- Take the straight path
  - Also the shortest
- This is called line segment
  - Finite length
- Line: extended in both ends
  - Infinite length
- Ray: extended in one end
  - Infinite length
