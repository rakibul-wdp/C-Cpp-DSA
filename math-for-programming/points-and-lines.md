# Recap

- GCD and LCM
- Euclidean algorithm for GCD (and LCM too)
- Factorials and a combinatorial problem
- Matrix and an application of them
- Power and roots
- Sets and set operations

# Basic Geometry

- Points and lines
- Coordinate System
- Angles
- Some geometric shapes

# Point

- Just a dot
- Location only
- No length, width, shape, size

# Line

- Two different points
- Connect them
- Take the straight path
  - Also the shortest
- This is called line segment
  - Finite length
- Line: extended in both ends
  - Infinite length
- Ray: extended in one end
  - Infinite length

# Angle

- Between two rays extending from the same point
- Circular arc to annotate
- Full rotation = 360 degrees
- Acute Angle (<90deg)
- Right Angle (=90deg)
- Obtuse Angle (>90deg)

# Coordinate System

- How do you navigate in real life?
  - Reference point, directions, distance etc
- How to identify a point in space?

  - Coordinate System!
  - Remember number line? One-dimensional coordinate system.

- 2D coordinate system
- Take two perpendicular lines
  - Right angle / 90 degrees
  - Horizontal: X axis
  - Vertical: Y axis
- Intersection point: Origin (0, 0)
- Any point can be identified as a pair of numbers

  - (x, y)
  - Where is (-2, 5)?

- How about 3D coordinate system?
  - (x, y, z)
  - Hard to visualize on paper
  - But easier in real life
