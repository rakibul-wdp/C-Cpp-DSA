# Series

- Sequence: List of numbers with some order or pattern
  - 1, 3, 5, 7, 7
  - 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...
- Series: Sum of elements in a sequence
  - S1 = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9
  - s2 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + ...
- Finite vs Infinite series
- Arithmetic vs Geometric Series
  - 1 + 6 + 11 + 16 + 21 + ...
  - 2 + 6 + 18 + 54 + ...

# 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + N = ?

- 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = ?
- Let,

  - s = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
  - s = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1
  - 2s = 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6
  - 2s = 5 x 6
  - s = 15

- 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + N = ?
- Let,
  - s = N x (N + 1) / 2

# Series (Finite Sum)

- Arithmetic series
  - S = 2 + 5 + 8 + ...
  - Find the 100th number in this series.
  - Find the sum of first 100 numbers.
- nth term in arithmetic series: a + (n - 1) x d
  - 100th number = 2 + 99 x 3 = 299
- Sum of first n terms: n/2 {2a + (n - 1) x d}
- sum of first 100 numbers = 100/2 {2x2 + (100 - 1) x 3} = 15050

# Practice

- Find the straight line (shortest) distance between two points in a 3-dimensional space.

  - Points: A(-10, 23, 5) & B (31, -11, 76)

- To find the shortest distance between two points A and B in 3-dimensional space, you can use the Euclidean distance formula:

- Distance = √[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 + (z2 - z1)^2]

- In this case, point A has coordinates (-10, 23, 5), and point B has coordinates (31, -11, 76).

- So, plug these values into the formula:

- Distance = √[(31 - (-10))^2 + (-11 - 23)^2 + (76 - 5)^2]

- Distance = √[(41)^2 + (-34)^2 + (71)^2]

- Distance = √[1681 + 1156 + 5041]

- Distance = √(7882)

- Distance ≈ 88.75 (rounded to two decimal places)

- So, the shortest distance between points A(-10, 23, 5) and B(31, -11, 76) in 3-dimensional space is approximately 88.75 units.

- Find the area of the green region if the side length of the square is 10
- white circle 78.54
- green circle 157.0796
- So green region area is 78.5396

- Find the sum of first n odd numbers. Calculate for n = 10,100,1000
- To find the sum of the first n odd numbers, you can use the formula:
- Sum = n^2
- For n = 10:
- Sum = 10^2 = 100
- For n = 100:
- Sum = 100^2 = 10,000
- For n = 1000:
- Sum = 1000^2 = 1,000,000
- So, the sum of the first 10 odd numbers is 100, the sum of the first 100 odd numbers is 10,000, and the sum of the first 1000 odd numbers is 1,000,000.
