# Probability

- Probability is a number to indicate the chance or likelihood of a particular event
- Event: outcome of an experiment or process
- For example-
  - Tossing a coin is an experiment
  - Event would be the appearance of Head or Tail
- The number is between always between 0 to 1
  - Impossible event: 0
  - Certain event: 1
  - Everything in between
- P(event) = Number of ways it can happen / Number of all possible outcomes

- What is the probability of getting a prime number if you throw a 6-faced dice?
- All possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Target outcomes / prime numbers: 2, 3, 5
- P = 3/6 = 0.5

- What is the probability of getting exactly two heads if you throw three coins?
- Outcomes of single coin: H, T
- Two coins: HH, HT, TH, TT
- What about three coins?
- P = 3/8
- Can you do it without building the table?
- Number of possible outcomes: 2 x 2 x 2 = 8
- Outcomes with exactly 2 heads out of 3 trials
  - Choose 2 positions out of 3 for H
  - 3C2 = 3!/1!x2! = 3
- P = 3/8
