# Intro to sets

- A collection of objects
  - No specific order or index [Unlike matrix]
- Objects are called elements
- Example
  - Natural number set: {1, 2, 3, ...}
  - Name of your favorite sports: {football, badminton, volleyball}
- Subset:
  - A is a subset of B if all the elements of A is also in B
  - A = {10, 12, 29} and B = {101, 12, 10 , 29, 32}
- Universal Set:
  - Depends on context
  - Example:
    - When talking about numbers, universal set might be the set of Real Numbers
    - In case of set of favorite sports, universal set would be the set of all sports
- Empty/Null set:

  - Set with zero members: {} or theta

- Three set operations:
  - Union
  - Intersection
  - Complement
