- Unitary method and percentage
  - Solving problems
- Interest rate and related problems
- Mean and Median

# Combinatorics

- Number of ways to choose or arrange objects
- Arranging some objects in all possible orders
  - Remember factorial?
- Choose some objects out of a collection of objects
  - Combination problem
  - How many ways are there to choose r objects from a collection of n objects?
    - nCr = ?
- Choose and order some objects out of a collection of objects
  - Permutation problem
  - How many ways are there to arrange r objects from a collection of n objects?
    - nPr = ?

# nPr

- You have n object in hand (all different)
- You have r slots to put them (r <= n) in order
- Example:
  - Batting order of a 11 player cricket match from a squad of 15 players
  - Answering order in an exam to answer 4 out of 6 questions
  - Number of ways: 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 = 360
  - But could we write this?
    - (6x5x4x3x2x1)/(2x1) = 6!/2!
