# Time Complexity

- Assignment operation: a = b, x = 10, O(1) or BigO
- Compression operation: a > b, O(1)
- Mathematical operation: 2 + 6, O(1)
- Calling function: r = f(n)
- Inside of function work

- time complexity low to high
  - O(1) -> O(log n) -> O(root(n)) -> O(n) -> O(n^2) -> O(n^3) -> O(n^n) -> O(n!)
